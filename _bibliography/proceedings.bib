abstract = {Truth Value Judgment Task experiments (TVJTs) are a common means of investigating pragmatic competence, particularly with regards to scalar inference. We present a novel quantitative linking function from pragmatic competence to participant behavior on TVJTs, based upon a Bayesian probabilistic model of linguistic production. Our model captures a range of observed phenomena on TVJTs, including intermediate responses on a non-binary scale, population and individual-level variation, participant endorsement of false utterances, and variation in response due to so-called scalar diversity.},

  title={Symmetric alternatives and semantic uncertainty modulate scalar inference},
  author={Waldon, Brandon and Degen, Judith},
  url = {https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci20/papers/0029/index.html},
  abstract = {Scalar inferences are commonly assumed to involve both literal semantic interpretation and social cognitive reasoning. However, the precise way to characterize listeners’ representation of context - including the space of possible utterance alternatives as well as the space of possible conventional meanings associated with linguistic forms - is a matter of ongoing debate. We report a partial replication of a scalar inference priming study by Rees and Bott (2018), introducing a novel baseline condition against which to compare behavior across different priming treatments. We also investigate the effect of raising participants’ awareness of communicatively stronger alternatives that explicitly encode an exhaustive meaning (e.g. some but not all with respect to some). Our results suggest that exhaustive alternatives (which are ‘symmetric’ to canonical alternatives) can modulate the availability and strength of scalar inferences, and that semantic uncertainty is an independent channel through which scalar inferences are modulated. We discuss implications for theories of pragmatic competence.},

    title = {{Linguistic interpretation as inference under argument system uncertainty: the case of epistemic must}},
    author = {Waldon, Brandon},
    abstract = {Modern semantic analyses of epistemic language (incl. the modal must) can be characterized by the ‘credence assumption’: speakers have full certainty regarding the propositions that structure their epistemic states. Intuitively, however: a) speakers have graded, rather than categorical, commitment to these propositions, which are often never fully and explicitly articulated; b) listeners have higher- order uncertainty about this speaker uncertainty; c) must φ is used to communicate speaker commitment to some conclusion φ and to indicate speaker commitment to the premises that condition the conclusion. I explore the consequences of relaxing the credence assumption by extending the argument system semantic framework first proposed by Stone (1994) to a Bayesian probabilistic framework of modeling pragmatic interpretation (Goodman and Frank, 2016).},
